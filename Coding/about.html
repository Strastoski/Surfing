    <h2>About Surf It</h2>
    <p>
      Surf It was established in 2023 by Ezra Williams, a passionate surfer from Indonesia. Our surf shop is founded on Christian values, and our mission is to provide a welcoming and inclusive surfing community that embraces the spirit of love, respect, and unity.

      At Surf It, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to experience the joy of surfing. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced rider, our dedicated team of trainers from all around the world is here to help you become a better surfer. We take pride in guiding beginners to gain confidence in surfing on their own, and we're equally excited to help experienced surfers refine their skills and explore new horizons.

      Our values are deeply rooted in the Indonesian surf culture, which is characterized by a strong sense of community, humility, and reverence for nature. We embrace the spirit of "gotong-royong," working together as a team and supporting one another in our surfing journeys. Sustainability and environmental stewardship are also at the core of our values, as we seek to protect and preserve the beautiful oceans and beaches that bring us so much joy.
